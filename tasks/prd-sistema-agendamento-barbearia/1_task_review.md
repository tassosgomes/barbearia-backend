# Task 1.0 Review

## 1. Task Definition Validation
- Solution groups the four core projects under the root `.sln`, enabling the layered architecture required by the spec (`Barbearia.sln:6-15`).
- Application layer registers MediatR and FluentValidation so future CQRS handlers plug in cleanly (`src/Barbearia.Application/DependencyInjection.cs:10-15`).
- Infrastructure layer wires EF Core + SQL Server and exposes the shared `IUnitOfWork` to support transactional use cases (`src/Barbearia.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs:12-18`, `src/Barbearia.Infrastructure/Persistence/UnitOfWork.cs:7-19`).
- API host configures Serilog, OpenTelemetry, health check policy and project references needed to compose the layers (`src/Barbearia.Api/Program.cs:16-70`, `src/Barbearia.Api/Barbearia.Api.csproj:9-24`).
- Container assets and pipeline automate build, test and image packaging as requested (`Dockerfile:3-23`, `docker-compose.yml:1-35`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml:1-54`).
- Local setup guide documents required env vars, user-secrets usage and commands per success criteria (`docs/setup/local-development.md:1-50`).

## 2. Analysis of Applicable Rules
- `rules/code-standard.md`: Verified method naming, early returns, avoidance of flag params and per-method responsibilities. Noted exception on directory naming (PascalCase) kept intentionally to preserve standard .NET namespaces; flagging for product owner confirmation.
- `rules/logging.md`: API uses Serilog with configuration-based sinks and disables console writes outside the logging pipeline (`src/Barbearia.Api/appsettings.json:15-35`).
- `rules/tests.md`: No tests required for this bootstrap task, but CI keeps `dotnet test` with coverage (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:43-48`).
- `rules/unit-of -work.md`: Shared `UnitOfWork` abstraction exposed through DI to align with persistence guidelines (`src/Barbearia.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs:12-18`).

## 3. Code Review Summary
- Health check pipeline protects `/health` with API key + constant-time comparison to avoid timing attacks (`src/Barbearia.Api/Infrastructure/Authorization/HealthCheckApiKeyHandler.cs:12-23`).
- SQL Server health check executes lightweight probe using managed client and bubbles failures with context (`src/Barbearia.Api/Infrastructure/Monitoring/SqlDatabaseHealthCheck.cs:5-31`).
- Observability wired with OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics plus Serilog request logging, matching tech spec (`src/Barbearia.Api/Program.cs:35-54`, `src/Barbearia.Api/appsettings.json:15-39`).
- EF Core packages pinned to `8.0.8` to ensure compatibility with net8 runtime (`src/Barbearia.Infrastructure/Barbearia.Infrastructure.csproj:9-15`).
- `global.json` requests net8 SDK while allowing roll-forward to newer majors so environments with dotnet 9 still build (`global.json:1-5`).

## 4. Issues Addressed & Resolutions
- Updated EF Core packages from 9.x preview to stable 8.0.8 for runtime compatibility (`src/Barbearia.Infrastructure/Barbearia.Infrastructure.csproj:9-14`).
- Adjusted local setup documentation to reference the net8 SDK per project standard (`docs/setup/local-development.md:3-5`).
- Added `global.json` to pin SDK expectations while enabling CI/dev flexibility (`global.json:1-5`).
- Removed placeholder classes generated by templates to keep layers clean and rule-compliant.

## 5. Readiness & Testing
- Commands executed: `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet format`.
- Build succeeded and format check clean; task considered ready for integration pending final reviewer confirmation.
